"""
Database engine and session factory for all services.

All services share this module to get a PostgreSQL connection.
Uses SQLAlchemy's async engine with connection pooling so we don't
open/close a new DB connection for every API request (which would be slow).

Connection pool behaviour:
  - pool_size     = 10  → up to 10 connections kept open and reused
  - max_overflow  = 20  → up to 20 extra connections during traffic spikes
  - pool_recycle  = 1800 → recycle connections every 30 minutes (prevents stale connections)
  - pool_pre_ping = True → test connection before using it (detects dropped connections)
